# Copy Timely events to Tripletex

This utility is written in Go and features functionality to copy Timely events to Tripletex, a Norwegian accounting software.

This project has led to some developments of a commercial option. Bjerk has developed [refactored and deployed an integration](https://www.tripletex.no/integrasjoner/timely/) that does the same thing as this, but better.

## Install

brew install cobraz/tools/trippl-timely

**Notes**: The library is not tested on Linux or Windows. There are [executables available](https://github.com/cobraz/jira-to-tripletex/releases/latest) at every release >1.0.3
